Hi! I'm Samuel Lihn, a senior at the Edison Academy Magnet School. I'm an aspiring roboticist and competed in the FIRST Tech Challenge robotics
competition for three years. I have developed many web and mobile apps including
my winning submission to the NASA App Development Challenge. I am currently researching techniques for
magnetic field measurement on Lunar and Martian rovers in collaboration with Dr. Peter Chi at UCLA/GFSC.
I am also a co-founder and the Head of Instruction of Return STEM, a non-profit organization that offers free online programming classes.
