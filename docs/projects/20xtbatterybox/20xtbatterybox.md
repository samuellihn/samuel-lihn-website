This is a water-resistant battery enclosure for the brake light system on the JHU Baja SAE car. It is designed to withstand many battery replacement cycles while withstanding the vibrations and shocks experienced by the car during off-road racing. The enclosure is SLA 3D printed and clip tolerances were iteratively tuned to balance clip durability and ease of insertion. Qualification testing was performed to ensure water and shock resistance.
