description:  A prototype rover made to validate techniques for rover-based Crustal Magnetic Field Measurement, created in collaboration with Dr. Peter Chi at UCLA.
---

This project aims to develop techniques for crustal magnetic field measurement on the Moon and Mars using land-based rovers. Although past missions have carried magnetometers, the quality of the measurements cannot truly be used to construct the crustal magnetic field of a planet, as a single magnetometer is susceptible to interference from the rover's own components. 

The prototype rover will have 27 magnetometers mounted in a rectangular array and will measure and cancel out its own sources of magnetic interference. Calibration methods will be developed as part of this project so the rover can differentiate its own magnetic sources from ambient magnetic sources.

# Funding: UCLA

I am working on this project in collaboration with Dr. Peter Chi, a research geophysicist at the University of California, Los Angeles and a visiting scientist at the Goddard Space Flight Center. Visit his website [here](https://sites.google.com/site/peterchiresearch/).
